**What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?)**

The goal of my website is to showcase some of my favorite photos from over the years in a gallery/portfolio format. I want this website to highlight my absolute favorite images on the home page, so its what people see first. Users will also be able to get to know me (the face behind the camera) and I also want to add a contact page just to allow people a space to leave any comments or feedback they may have.

**Why is responsive web design important?**

Responsive web design is important because you want your website to present itself in its best format no matter how the user is viewing the site. Since the dimensions of a mobile phone are different than that of a desktop, some rules need to change so that users will receive the same value from their website despite their viewing screen of choice.

**This is the response to my lesson from this week (also in our emails)**

DADA / DATA / HUB - This website's texture is interesting- I like when backgrounds are off-white because they seem less harsh, the texture on this off-white background makes it feel extra welcoming. The texture on the words and the movement is something that draws my attention to the wrong parts of the screen I think - it also made it a bit difficult to see that there were three different options to click on, they were kind of hidden. The curvature of the words may have been where the emotions came from - that element made it feel like a search and like I was trying to decode something.
