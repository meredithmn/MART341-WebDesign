An IP address is a series of numbers that identify your computer as well as any websites you may visit. The DNS (or Domain Name System) provides the common names for the websites we access. This means that instead of searching for 8.8 8.8 we can simply search for Google because the computer can differentiate the DNS from the IP address and knows where to send you.

The three essential parts of a URL are Protocol, Domain, and Paths. The protocol is typically the "http" at the beginning of a website. This shows how the browser will interact with the server.

The paths are the further directions on how to navigate through the site, these paths will lead to the final destination which could be files, pages, or queries.
