      <h2>Hi, my name is Meredith Nichols</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This is a page I have made for my Intro to Web Design course at the University of Montana. This course is apart of my Marketing degree that I will graduate with in the fall of 2023. The images featured on the home page capture some of my favorite adventures from my college experience in and around Montana. Feel free to explore the Extras page as well for some more adventures :)</p>

      <h2> A bit about me - </h2>
      <p>I was born in Texas, and quickly moved to Colorado, where I began documenting most of my adventures. I got behind a camera in middle school and pursued that throughout high school. Landscape photography has been something I enjoy capturing because there are so many places to go. I'd never been to Montana and the first time I visited was to tour UM - I knew there would be so many more beautiful places to see. </p>
